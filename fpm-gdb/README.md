# fpm-gdb

Small program to call the GNU debugger program gdb(1) from fpm on
GNU/Linux and Unix systems. To install the program assuming you have
fpm(1) installed enter:

     git clone https://github.com/lockstockandbarrel/oort-cloud
     cd fpm-gdb
     fpm install

and then in fpm(1) projects enter

     fpm gdb

to launch the debugger in vim(1) mode on the project app.


## **NAME**
   fpm-gdb(1f) - launch gdb(1) in vim(1) from fpm(1)
   (LICENSE:MIT)

## **SYNOPSIS**
    fpm-gdb [PROGRAM][OPTIONS][ --help|--version]

## **DESCRIPTION**
   fpm-gdb(1f) is an fpm(1) plugin that starts up gdb(1) in the vim(1)
   editor.

   It uses the vim(1) terminal feature. The terminal feature is optional.
   Enter this in vim(1) to check if your version has it:

       :echo has('terminal')

   If the result is "1" you have it.

## **OPTIONS**

 + **PROGRAM**     
   : if more than one application is built by the package
   the name must be specified. Unlike with the "fpm run"
   command wildcards are not permitted.

 + **--gdb CMDS**  
   : pass initial commands to gdb(1)

 + **-wide,-w**    
   : assume a wide screen width. Wide mode places the
   code in a window on the left of the screen. <C-W>
   followed by one of {RHKLJ} can change the window
   layout.

 + **--test**      
   : use subcommand "test" instead of the default "run"
   in order to select test programs. If --test is specified
   --example is ignored.

 + **--verbose,-V**  
   : verbose mode

 + **--version,-v**  
   : Print version information on standard output then
   exit successfully.

 + **--help,-h**     
   : Print usage information on standard output then
   exit successfully.

   In addition, the following options from the fpm(1) "run" subcommand
   are supported, noting that "--profile debug" is always specified as
   well ...

       --example    --no-prune  --link-flag  --flag
       --directory  --compiler  --c-flag     --c-compiler
       --archiver

## **GETTING STARTED**
Lets start in a terminal at least 132 characters wide and enter

     fpm gdb --wide

and then in the gdb(1) command window enter

    b main
    info sources
    info functions
    b file.F90:routine
    run

This will set a breakpoint at the beginning of the program, list the files
in scope for debugging, list the procedures, set some other breakpoint
in file "file.F90" at top of procedure "routine" and then start running
the program (with optional arguments).  Clicking on "next" would take
you to the next breakpoint.

For some compilers "b 1"(e.g. Intel) might be required instead of "b
main"(e.g gfortran).

Many other commands exist.  Assuming you are at your next breakpoint,
you can ask where you are, list local variables and print the value of
some variable, like "i"

    where
    info locals
    print i

## **USING THE MOUSE**

Assuming your terminal window supports vim(1) mouse mode, you can use
the mouse in various ways. For example

###    ***TO SET BREAK POINTS***

   If you click the right mouse in the code file you should get an option
   menu for setting and clearing breakpoints.

###    ***TO EVALATE VARIABLES***

   click on variables to highlight them and click the [eval] icon.

## **SCROLLING**

The gdb and output windows will not be in Normal mode and so
will not scroll by default. When focus is on the window that will not
scroll enter "ctrl-W N" to go to scrollable, and enter "i" to return
to the original mode.

On some platforms instead of "ctrl-W" followed by capital "N" you can
define which key goes to Normal mode. For example, to define F1 to
switch to Terminal-Normal mode:

     :tnoremap <F1> <C-W>N

In the gdb window in particular, you probably want to toggle between
the modes, because when scrolling is on command recall is not.

When in Normal mode your interaction with the program is suspended,
so you want to return to the original mode or you cannot enter commands
in the gdb pane and cannot see new output or enter input in Normal mode.
To leave scrollable mode (enter "i") in the pane.

Check out :help window-moving for more information on changing the
window layout.

## **MORE INFO**

General gdb instructions are beyond the scope of this discussion, but
"help" in the gdb pane can get you started. At least look at watch,
display, list, break, info, where, print, set, next, step, and info after
you get started with the basics.

For the vim(1) terminal help go to the rightmost vim(1) window and enter
":help terminal-debug".

## **EXAMPLES**
     fpm gdb

     fpm gdb --compiler gfortran

     # run with initial gdb(1) commands in a file
     fpm gdb -wide -gdb 'source mycmds.gdb'

     fpm gdb --example demo1
